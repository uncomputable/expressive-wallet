# Expressive Wallet Problem

Trigger warning: math ⚠️

"Given a set of coin denominations, what is a minimal wallet that can express all amounts up to a target amount?"

This math problem actually has some use in daily life! Always pay the bill exactly ✅

## Example: Euro cents 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50

Here are minimal wallets for targets 0 to 100.

It is surprising how slowly the wallet grows with respect to the target. I can't help but see a skyscraper.
